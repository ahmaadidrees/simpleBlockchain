# Simple Blockchain

Simple Blockchain is a basic implementation of a blockchain data structure using Golang. It provides a simplified demonstration of how a blockchain works, including block creation, validation, and proof-of-work consensus algorithm.

## Features

- Blockchain data structure with blocks and transactions.
- Proof-of-work algorithm for block validation.
- Mining new blocks and adding them to the chain.
- Basic transaction functionality.

## Installation

To run the Simple Blockchain locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ahmaadidrees/simpleBlockchain.git

3. Navigate to the project directory: cd simpleBlockchain

4. Run the application: go run main.go

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to interact with the blockchain.

## Usage

Once you have the Simple Blockchain running, you can perform the following actions:

- View the current blockchain and all the blocks.
- Mine new blocks and add them to the chain.
- Create new transactions and add them to the pending transactions pool.
- Check the balance of a specific wallet address.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Simple Blockchain implementation to suit your needs. Here are a few suggestions:

- Implement additional features like wallet management, transaction verification, or network communication between nodes.
- Improve the user interface by using a front-end framework or creating a web-based interface.
- Experiment with different consensus algorithms or cryptographic techniques.
